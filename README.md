## Description

A toolkit for creating and using [Lindenmayer Systems][l-system] (L-systems).
It consists of a class that allows for declaration of the L-system's grammar,
and another class that allows for the definition of how the symbols output by a
grammar should be translated into work.

**Note** if you just want to draw with it, you should consider using
[kaki-lsystem][] instead; it has a nice interface with drawing already
integrated. This gem is intended for using l-systems for things other than
drawing (though it can obviously do that too), so it requires a bit more work.


### Examples

Most of these were stolen from [the examples on Wikipedia][l-system], and can be found in the `examples/` directory of the source.

#### Algae

Lindenmayer's original L-system for modelling the growth of algae.

* variables : A B
* constants : none
* axiom : A
* rules : (A → AB), (B → A)

Declare the rules:

    algae = LSystem.declare do
    
    	variables :A, :B
    	axiom 'A'
    	rules 'A -> AB',
    	    'B -> A'
    
    end

then iterate it 8 times and print out each generation:

    iter = algae.each
    8.times do |i|
        puts "n = %d : %s" % [ i, iter.next ]
    end

This outputs:

    n = 0 : A
    n = 1 : AB
    n = 2 : ABA
    n = 3 : ABAAB
    n = 4 : ABAABABA
    n = 5 : ABAABABAABAAB
    n = 6 : ABAABABAABAABABAABABA
    n = 7 : ABAABABAABAABABAABABAABAABABAABAAB


You can also do more complex tasks with the symbols in each generation. For example, to generate pretty pictures.

#### Barnsley fern

* variables : X F
* constants : + − [ ]
* axiom : X
* rules : (X → F+[[X]-X]-F[-FX]+X), (F → FF)
* angle : 25°

Declare the rules:

    fern = LSystem.declare do
    
      variables 'X', 'F'
      constants '+', '-', '[', ']'
      axiom 'X'
      rules \
        'X → F+[[X]-X]-F[-FX]+X',
        'F → FF'
    
    end

Then hook them up to a Logo interpreter ([a monkeypatched version][tortoise-patch] of the [Tortoise gem][tortoise-gem]):

    LSystem.run( fern, 8 ) do
    
      # The size of the canvas to draw on
      CANVAS_SIZE = 2000
    
      # F: draw forward
      # X : no-op
      # -: turn left 25°
      # +: turn right 25°
      # [: push position and angle
      # ]: pop position and angle
      production_map \
        'F' => :forward,
        '-' => :turn_left,
        '+' => :turn_right,
        '[' => :save_pos_and_angle,
        ']' => :restore_pos_and_angle
    
      ### Set up some instance variables
      def initialize( * )
        super
        @turtle = nil
        @positions = []
      end
    
    
      on_start do |i, _|
        @turtle = Tortoise::Interpreter.new( CANVAS_SIZE )
        @turtle.setpos( CANVAS_SIZE / 2, 0 )
        @turtle.direction = 90
        @turtle.pd
      end
    
    
      on_finish do |i, _|
        File.open( "fern_gn#{i}.png", File::WRONLY|File::TRUNC|File::CREAT, 0644, encoding: 'binary' ) do |fh|
          fh.write( @turtle.to_png )
        end
      end
    
    
      ### Draw a line forward
      def forward
        @turtle.fd( 5 )
      end
    
    
      ### Turn 25° to the left
      def turn_left
        @turtle.lt( 25 )
      end
    
    
      ### Turn 25° to the right
      def turn_right
        @turtle.rt( 25 )
      end
    
    
      ### Save the drawing position and angle
      def save_pos_and_angle
        @positions.push([ @turtle.position, @turtle.direction ])
      end
    
    
      ### Restore the next saved position and angle
      def restore_pos_and_angle
        to_restore = @positions.pop or raise IndexError, "Position stack underflow"
    
        @turtle.setpos( *to_restore.first )
        @turtle.direction = to_restore.last
      end
    
    end

This generates a sequence of images, which for generation 8 yields:

![Fern Gen 7](examples/fern_gn7.png)
